Use a full carafe (12 cups) of fresh cold water. This will remove any dust from the manufacturing process or residues that have remained in the unit. • Open the reservoir cover (5). • When filling the water reservoir (3) with fresh cold water, refer to the carafe height markings or the water level indicator (inside the water reservoir) and fill to the desired number of cups. • To prepare the exact amount of coffee for the Braun thermal mug (available separately as accessory), fill to the corresponding water mark (330 ml) inside the reservoir. • Insert a paper filter (cone type # 4) in the filter basket (4). • Alternatively you can use the gold tone permanent filter which is available separately. • Add the desired amount of ground coffee, corresponding to the number of cups being brewed. We recommend using 1 coffee measuring scoop of ground coffee per cup, but use more or less to suit your taste. • Close the water reservoir and place the carafe in its position on the keep warm plate (6). • Plug the cord into an electrical outlet. • Press the START button (a) to start brewing immediately or press TIMER (b) to commence brewing at the pre-set time. • During brewing, the indicator light will flash continuously. Once the brewing cycle is complete, the light will turn solid green indicating the coffee maker is in «keep warm» mode. NOTE: The anti-drip system halts the flow of coffee from the filter basket when the carafe is removed, so a cup can be poured before brewing is finished. The carafe should be returned to the keep warm plate (maximum 20 seconds) to prevent the filter basket from overflowing. For Best Results • When using paper filters, be sure that it is completely open and fully inserted in the basket.

Before the indicator protrudes \nfrom the cup tray, the drip tray must be emptied and cleaned \notherwise the water may overflow the edge and damage the \nappliance, the surface it rests on or the surrounding area.\n1. Remove the drip tray (fig. 21).\n2. Remove the cup tray (A7), empty the water and clean the \ndrip tray with a cloth, then reassemble the drip tray. Ex\u0002tract the mugs or glasses tray (A10), clean with water, dry \nand put back in the machine,\n3. Put the drip tray back in place.\n16.3 Cleaning the coffee filters\nClean the coffee filters regularly:\n1. Rinse the filters under running water (fig. 22),\n2. Make sure the holes are not blocked. If necessary, clean \nwith a pin (figs. 22 and 23).\n16.4 Cleaning the boiler outlet\nAfter every 200 coffees, rinse the boiler outlet by delivering \nabout 0.5 l of water from the boiler outlet (press the coffee but\u0002ton without using ground coffee).\n16.5 Other cleaning operations\n1. Do not use solvents or abrasive detergents to clean the cof\u0002fee maker. Use a soft damp cloth only.\n2. Clean the filter holder cup.\n16.6 Cleaning the water tank\n1. Clean the water tank regularly (about once a month) and \nwhenever you replace the water softener filter (C6, *if pro\u0002vided) with a damp cloth and a little mild washing up liquid,\n2. Remove the filter (*if present) and rinse with running \nwater,\n3. Put the filter (*if provided) back in the appliance, fill the \ntank with fresh water and replace the tank,\n4. (Models with water softener filter only) Deliver about 100 \nml of water.\nDanger!\nWhile cleaning, never immerse the coffee maker in water. It is \nan electrical appliance.\n13\n16.7 Descale\nDescale the appliance when the orange light on the but\u0002ton comes on.\nImportant! \n• Before use, read the instructions and the labelling on the \ndescaler pack.\n• You should use De'Longhi descaler only. Using unsuitable \ndescaler and\/or performing descaling incorrectly may re\u0002sult in faults not covered by the manufacturer's guarantee.\nProceed as follows:\n1. (IF PRESENT, REMOVE THE WATER SOFTENER FILTER). Fill \nthe tank with the descaler solution, obtained by diluting \nthe descaler provided with water (fill the water tank up to \nthe MAX level).\n2. Press the ON\/OFF button.\n3. Make sure the filter holder is not attached and position a \nrecipient under the hot water spout and boiler outlet (A5) \n(fig. 24).\n4. Wait for the and lights to come on steadily, \nindicating that the appliance is ready for use.\n5. Press and hold the button for 10 seconds until the \nthree buttons flash in sequence.\n6. Turn the steam dial to the position.\n7. Press the button to start descaling.\n8. The descale programme starts and the descaler liquid \ncomes out of the water spout. The descale programme \nremoves limescale deposits from inside the appliance by \nautomatically performing a series of rinses and pausesuntil \nthe tank is completely empty.\n Please note: \nDuring descaling, to clean the boiler outlet, close the steam dial \nfrom time to time to deliver small quantities of descaler from \nthe boiler outlet.\n9. The appliance stops operation and the orange \nlight continues to flash, indicating that descaling is still \nunderway.\n10. The appliance is now ready for rinsing through with clean \nwater. Extract the water tank, empty, rinse under running \nwater, fill with fresh water up to the MAX level and put \nback in the appliance (If used, insert the water softener \nfilter).\n11. Empty the container used to collect the descaler solution \nand replace it empty under the hot water spout.\n12. Make sure the steam dial is in the position, then \npress the button to start rinsing.\n Please note: \nDuring rinsing, to clean the boiler outlet, close the steam dial \nfrom time to time to deliver small quantities of water from the \nboiler outlet.\n13. When the water tank is empty, the orange light goes out \nand descaling is complete.\n14. Make sure the steam dial is in the closed position (○\nsymbol).\nThe appliance is ready for use.\n Please note! \n• If the descaling cycle is not completed correctly (e.g. no \nelectricity) we recommend repeating the cycle,\n• If the water tank has not been filled to the MAX level, at the \nend of descaling, the appliance requests a further rinse to \nguarantee that the descaler solution has been completely \neliminated from the machine's internal circuits.\nRepair of damage to the coffee maker caused by limescale is not \ncovered by the guarantee unless descaling is performed regular\u0002ly as described above.","question":"What should you do to avoid splashes when removing the filter holder?"},"meta":{},"created_at":"2022-12-26T19:22:58.798192Z","updated_at":"2022-12-26T20:31:51.515768Z","inner_id":147,"total_annotations":0,"cancelled_annotations":1,"total_predictions":0,"comment_count":0,"unresolved_comment_count":0,"last_comment_updated_at":null,"project":1,"updated_by":1,"comment_authors":[]},{"id":148,"annotations":[{"id":149,"completed_by":1,"result":[],"was_cancelled":true,"ground_truth":false,"created_at":"2022-12-26T20:32:43.244536Z","updated_at":"2022-12-26T20:32:43.244536Z","lead_time":51.348,"prediction":{},"result_count":0,"task":148,"project":1,"parent_prediction":null,"parent_annotation":null}],"file_upload":"8ceafce4-questionsJochen.json","drafts":[],"predictions":[],"data":{"context":"13.

Clean the water tank regularly (about once a month) and \nwhenever you replace the water softener filter (C6, *if pro\u0002vided) with a damp cloth and a little mild washing up liquid,\n2. Remove the filter (*if present) and rinse with running \nwater,\n3. Put the filter (*if provided) back in the appliance, fill the \ntank with fresh water and replace the tank,\n4. (Models with water softener filter only) Deliver about 100 \nml of water.\nDanger!\nWhile cleaning, never immerse the coffee maker in water. It is \nan electrical appliance.\n13\n16.7 Descale\nDescale the appliance when the orange light on the but\u0002ton comes on.\nImportant! \n• Before use, read the instructions and the labelling on the \ndescaler pack.\n• You should use De'Longhi descaler only. Using unsuitable \ndescaler and\/or performing descaling incorrectly may re\u0002sult in faults not covered by the manufacturer's guarantee.\nProceed as follows:\n1. (IF PRESENT, REMOVE THE WATER SOFTENER FILTER). Fill \nthe tank with the descaler solution, obtained by diluting \nthe descaler provided with water (fill the water tank up to \nthe MAX level).\n2. Press the ON\/OFF button.\n3. Make sure the filter holder is not attached and position a \nrecipient under the hot water spout and boiler outlet (A5) \n(fig. 24).\n4. Wait for the and lights to come on steadily, \nindicating that the appliance is ready for use.\n5. Press and hold the button for 10 seconds until the \nthree buttons flash in sequence.\n6. Turn the steam dial to the position.\n7. Press the button to start descaling.\n8. The descale programme starts and the descaler liquid \ncomes out of the water spout. The descale programme \nremoves limescale deposits from inside the appliance by \nautomatically performing a series of rinses and pausesuntil \nthe tank is completely empty.\n Please note: \nDuring descaling, to clean the boiler outlet, close the steam dial \nfrom time to time to deliver small quantities of descaler from \nthe boiler outlet.\n9. The appliance stops operation and the orange \nlight continues to flash, indicating that descaling is still \nunderway.\n10. The appliance is now ready for rinsing through with clean \nwater. Extract the water tank, empty, rinse under running \nwater, fill with fresh water up to the MAX level and put \nback in the appliance (If used, insert the water softener \nfilter).\n11. Empty the container used to collect the descaler solution \nand replace it empty under the hot water spout.\n12. Make sure the steam dial is in the position, then \npress the button to start rinsing.\n Please note: \nDuring rinsing, to clean the boiler outlet, close the steam dial \nfrom time to time to deliver small quantities of water from the \nboiler outlet.\n13. When the water tank is empty, the orange light goes out \nand descaling is complete.\n14. Make sure the steam dial is in the closed position (○\nsymbol).\nThe appliance is ready for use.\n Please note! \n• If the descaling cycle is not completed correctly (e.g. no \nelectricity) we recommend repeating the cycle,\n• If the water tank has not been filled to the MAX level, at the \nend of descaling, the appliance requests a further rinse to \nguarantee that the descaler solution has been completely \neliminated from the machine's internal circuits.\nRepair of damage to the coffee maker caused by limescale is not \ncovered by the guarantee unless descaling is performed regular\u0002ly as described above.","question":"How do you store the appliance?"},"meta":{},"created_at":"2022-12-26T19:22:58.802226Z","updated_at":"2022-12-26T20:38:54.472887Z","inner_id":161,"total_annotations":0,"cancelled_annotations":1,"total_predictions":0,"comment_count":0,"unresolved_comment_count":0,"last_comment_updated_at":null,"project":1,"updated_by":1,"comment_authors":[]}]
