;How should the machine be placed when starting it for the first time?;GETTING STARTED Place the machine on a flat surface. When starting the machine for the first time, fill the tank with cold water. Start the machine with the ON/OFF switch. Let a full tank of water pass through the machine once or twice to clean it, without using paper filter or coffee. Making coffee: open the lid and fill the water tank with fresh cold water up to the desired level. There is a water-level indicator for 2–10 big cups / 3–15 small cups inside the water tank. Insert paper filter into filter basket and fill it with ground coffee. There is a gauge for recommended number of spoons of coffee next to the water gauge. For medium-strength coffee, one measuring spoon (approx. 6-7 g) per cup is sufficient. Close the water tank lid and place the jug (complete with lid) onto the warming plate. Start the machine with the ON/OFF switch. The power indicator light will come on and hot water will flow into the filter. When water has stopped flowing, the warming plate keeps the coffee hot until the machine is turned off with the ON/OFF switch. If the machine is not turned off manually, the Safety Auto-Off function turns it off after 40 minutes. If the jug is removed, the filter valve prevents coffee from dripping onto the warming plate. While boiling, the jug must not be removed for longer than 30 seconds or the filter will overflow. The Aroma Selector extends the brewing time to maximize the flavour extraction and get a stronger coffee for a small number of cups (normally less than 6). Press the Aroma button, and the aroma icon will turn on.

;How do you properly use a paper filter in the filter basket?;(B) Making Coffee Before using the coffee maker for the first time, after a long period of not using it, run the coffee maker through a complete brew cycle without ground coffee. Use a full carafe (12 cups) of fresh cold water. This will remove any dust from the manufacturing process or residues that have remained in the unit. • Open the reservoir cover (5). • When filling the water reservoir (3) with fresh cold water, refer to the carafe height markings or the water level indicator (inside the water reservoir) and fill to the desired number of cups. • To prepare the exact amount of coffee for the Braun thermal mug (available separately as accessory), fill to the corresponding water mark (330 ml) inside the reservoir. • Insert a paper filter (cone type # 4) in the filter basket (4). • Alternatively you can use the gold tone permanent filter which is available separately. • Add the desired amount of ground coffee, corresponding to the number of cups being brewed. We recommend using 1 coffee measuring scoop of ground coffee per cup, but use more or less to suit your taste. • Close the water reservoir and place the carafe in its position on the keep warm plate (6). • Plug the cord into an electrical outlet. • Press the START button (a) to start brewing immediately or press TIMER (b) to commence brewing at the pre-set time. • During brewing, the indicator light will flash continuously. Once the brewing cycle is complete, the light will turn solid green indicating the coffee maker is in «keep warm» mode. NOTE: The anti-drip system halts the flow of coffee from the filter basket when the carafe is removed, so a cup can be poured before brewing is finished. The carafe should be returned to the keep warm plate (maximum 20 seconds) to prevent the filter basket from overflowing. For Best Results • When using paper filters, be sure that it is completely open and fully inserted in the basket. It may help to fold and flatten the seams of the paper filter beforehand. • Once the coffee has finished brewing, stir it before serving to blend the flavors. The coffee at the bottom of the carafe will be somewhat stronger than the coffee at the top. Note: The maximum amount of ground coffee the coffee maker can take is 11 coffee measuring scoops. Exceeding this amount may cause overflow.

;What should be done if the LED CALC light turns solid green?;Descaling For the best performance from your Braun coffee maker, descale the unit when the LED CALC (c) lights up solid green. This indicates it is time to descale your coffee maker. To set water hardness see «Setting the Water Hardness Level». The removal of built-up calcium deposits from the water reservoir will help extend the life of your coffee maker and keep your coffee tasting great. Frequency will depend upon the hardness of your tap water and how often you use the coffee maker. You can use a commercially available decalcifying agent not affecting aluminum. We recommend using the Braun Descaling Solution (can be purchased in stores, through the Braun website, or by calling Customer Service). Note: The entire cleaning cycle including rinsing can take up to 45 minutes to complete. • Follow the package instructions of the decalcifying agent. • Place the empty carafe in its position on the keep warm plate (6). • Press the CALC button (c) to select the descaling program. • The green LED above the button will start flashing. • To start the descaling program press START (a). The green LED is still flashing. • When the descaling program has been completed, the green LED (c) will turn off. • Discard the cleaning solution and rinse the carafe thoroughly with clean water. • Fill the water reservoir with a full carafe (12 cups) of clean, fresh water. Run the coffee maker through two complete brew cycles to flush the unit after descaling. Use a full carafe of fresh cold water each time. • Repeat the procedure as many times as necessary in order to reduce the brewing time per cup to a normal level.

;How do you make one espresso coffee using pre-ground coffee?;"10. HOW TO MAKE ESPRESSO COFFEE
10.1 Tips for a hotter coffee
For hotter espresso coffee, you should:
• You are recommended to warm the cups before making 
coffee by rinsing them with a little hot water.
• Attach the filter holder to the appliance with the filter in 
place but without adding coffee. Using the same cup 
as will later be used to make the coffee, press the 1 cup 
button and deliver hot water into the cup to heat it.
• Raise the coffee temperature in the settings menu.
• Rest the cups you will be using on the cup warmer (A4) 
which becomes hot during operation.
10.2 How to prepare espresso coffee using preground coffee
1. Place the ground coffee filter (C2 or C3) in the filter holder 
(fig. 6). To make one coffee, use the filter with the 
symbol on the bottom, to make two coffees, use the filter 
with the symbol on the bottom.
2. To make just one coffee, place one level measure of preground coffee (about 7 g) in the filter (fig. 7). To make two 
coffees, place two loosely filled measures (about 7+7 g) of 
pre-ground coffee in the filter. Fill the filter a little at a time 
to prevent the pre-ground coffee from overflowing.
 Important: 
For correct operation, before filling with pre-ground coffee, 
make sure there are no coffee residues left in the filter from the 
last time you made coffee.
3. Distribute the pre-ground coffee evenly and press lightly 
with the presser (fig. 8).
Correct pressing of the pre-ground coffee is essential to 
obtain a good espresso. If you press too firmly, the coffee 
will be delivered slowly and will be strong. If you press 
too lightly, the coffee will be delivered quickly and will be 
weak.
4. Remove any excess coffee from the rim of the filter holder 
and attach the filter holder to the appliance. To attach correctly, align the filter holder handle with the INSERT symbol (fig. 9), attach the filter holder and rotate the handle 
towards the right until aligned with the CLOSE symbol.
5. Place the cup or cups under the filter holder spouts (fig. 
10). 
6. Make sure the lights corresponding to the coffee buttons 
are on, then press the or coffee button. The 
appliance proceeds to make the coffee and delivery is interrupted automatically.
7. To remove the filter holder, turn the handle from right to 
left.
 Danger of burns! 
To avoid splashes, never remove the filter holder while the 
appliance is delivering coffee. Always wait for a few seconds 
after delivery.
10.3 How to make espresso coffee using pods
 Please note: 
Use pods conforming to the ESE standard, indicated on the pack 
by the following symbol. 
The ESE standard is a system accepted by leading pod producers and enables espresso coffee 
to be prepared simply and cleanly.
1. Place the filter for coffee pods (with the symbol on 
the bottom) in the filter holder.
2. Insert the pod, centring it as far as possible on the filter 
(fig. 11). Always follow the instructions on the pod pack to 
position the pod on the filter correctly. 
Proceed as described in points 4 to 6 in the previous section.
 Please note: 
• While the appliance is making coffee, delivery can be interrupted at any moment by pressing the coffee button 
pressed previously.
• At the end of delivery (within 3 seconds), to increase the 
amount of coffee in the cup, press and hold the coffee button pressed previously. Delivery is automatically interrupted after a few seconds.
• To remove the filter holder, turn the handle from right to 
left.
 Danger of burns! 
To avoid splashes, never remove the filter holder while the

2. Press the button (fig. 12). The light flashes,
3. In the meantime, fill a recipient with about 100 grams of 
milk for each cappuccino to be prepared. For a denser more 
even froth, you must use skimmed or partially skimmed 
milk at refrigerator temperature (about 5°C). In choosing 
the size of the recipient, bear in mind that the milk doubles 
or triples in volume (fig. 13).
4. Make sure the cappuccino maker selection ring (A14) is in 
the ""CAPPUCCINO"" position (fig. 14),
