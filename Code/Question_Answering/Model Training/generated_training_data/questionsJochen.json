Making coffee: open the lid and fill the water tank with fresh cold water up to the desired level. There is a water-level indicator for 2\u201310 big cups / 3\u201315 small cups inside the water tank. Insert paper filter into filter basket and fill it with ground coffee. There is a gauge for recommended number of spoons of coffee next to the water gauge. For medium-strength coffee, one measuring spoon (approx. 6-7 g) per cup is sufficient. Close the water tank lid and place the jug (complete with lid) onto the warming plate. Start the machine with the ON/OFF switch. The power indicator light will come on and hot water will flow into the filter. When water has stopped flowing, the warming plate keeps the coffee hot until the machine is turned off with the ON/OFF switch. If the machine is not turned off manually, the Safety Auto-Off function turns it off after 40 minutes. If the jug is removed, the filter valve prevents coffee from dripping onto the warming plate. While boiling, the jug must not be removed for longer than 30 seconds or the filter will overflow.

This indicates it is time to descale your coffee maker. To set water hardness see \u00abSetting the Water Hardness Level\u00bb. The removal of built-up calcium deposits from the water reservoir will help extend the life of your coffee maker and keep your coffee tasting great. Frequency will depend upon the hardness of your tap water and how often you use the coffee maker. You can use a commercially available decalcifying agent not affecting aluminum.

Using the same cup \nas will later be used to make the coffee, press the 1 cup \nbutton and deliver hot water into the cup to heat it.\n\u2022 Raise the coffee temperature in the settings menu.\n\u2022 Rest the cups you will be using on the cup warmer (A4) \nwhich becomes hot during operation.\n10.2 How to prepare espresso coffee using pre\u0002ground coffee\n1. Place the ground coffee filter (C2 or C3) in the filter holder \n(fig. 6). To make one coffee, use the filter with the \nsymbol on the bottom, to make two coffees, use the filter \nwith the symbol on the bottom.\n2. To make just one coffee, place one level measure of pre\u0002ground coffee (about 7 g) in the filter (fig. 7). To make two \ncoffees, place two loosely filled measures (about 7+7 g) of \npre-ground coffee in the filter. Fill the filter a little at a time \nto prevent the pre-ground coffee from overflowing.\n Important: \nFor correct operation, before filling with pre-ground coffee, \nmake sure there are no coffee residues left in the filter from the \nlast time you made coffee.\n3. Distribute the pre-ground coffee evenly and press lightly \nwith the presser (fig. 8).\nCorrect pressing of the pre-ground coffee is essential to \nobtain a good espresso. If you press too firmly, the coffee \nwill be delivered slowly and will be strong. If you press \ntoo lightly, the coffee will be delivered quickly and will be \nweak.\n4. Remove any excess coffee from the rim of the filter holder \nand attach the filter holder to the appliance. To attach cor\u0002rectly, align the filter holder handle with the INSERT sym\u0002bol (fig. 9), attach the filter holder and rotate the handle \ntowards the right until aligned with the CLOSE symbol.\n5. Place the cup or cups under the filter holder spouts (fig. \n10). \n6. Make sure the lights corresponding to the coffee buttons \nare on, then press the or coffee button. The \nappliance proceeds to make the coffee and delivery is in\u0002terrupted automatically.\n7. To remove the filter holder, turn the handle from right to \nleft.\n Danger of burns! \nTo avoid splashes, never remove the filter holder while the \nappliance is delivering coffee. Always wait for a few seconds \nafter delivery.\n10.3 How to make espresso coffee using pods\n Please note: \nUse pods conforming to the ESE standard, indicated on the pack \nby the following symbol. \nThe ESE standard is a system accepted by lead\u0002ing pod producers and enables espresso coffee \nto be prepared simply and cleanly.\n1. Place the filter for coffee pods (with the symbol on \nthe bottom) in the filter holder.\n2. Insert the pod, centring it as far as possible on the filter \n(fig. 11). Always follow the instructions on the pod pack to \nposition the pod on the filter correctly. \nProceed as described in points 4 to 6 in the previous section.\n Please note: \n\u2022 While the appliance is making coffee, delivery can be in\u0002terrupted at any moment by pressing the coffee button \npressed previously.\n\u2022 At the end of delivery (within 3 seconds), to increase the \namount of coffee in the cup, press and hold the coffee button pressed previously. Delivery is automatically interrupt\u0002ed after a few seconds.\n\u2022 To remove the filter holder, turn the handle from right to \nleft.\n Danger of burns! \nTo avoid splashes, never remove the filter holder while the \nappliance is delivering coffee. Always wait for a few seconds \nafter delivery.\n10.4 Programming the quantities of coffee in \nthe cup\nThe appliance is set by default to automatically deliver standard \nquantities.
